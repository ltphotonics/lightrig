# Light Trace Photonics

See [our website](https://www.ltphotonics.co.uk/) for more details.

A Python Library for interfacing with **Light Trace Photonics** hardware. This module lets you control LTP's automated chip testing rig. It provides 
a main LightRig class which reads in device & measurement information, performs scans, and save data for the user. It also provides two additional classes, one for taking measurements with Thorlabs photodiodes and one for controlling an Osics Mainframe laser. Note, these can be modififed to different laser and phototdiode interfacing if required.

## Installation

Requirements:
- A Python 3.6 or greater interpreter.

Dependencies
- `libusb` is required for the backend of pyusb.
- `pyvisa-py` is required to connect to Thorlabs photodiodes.
- `pyusb` is required to connect to Thorlabs photodiodes.
- `pyserial` is required to connect to an Oscis Mainframe laser.
- `qontrol` to interfacing with the required Qontrol M2 driver boards (See [Qontrol's website](https://qontrol.co.uk/) for more details).
- `numpy` is required to perform calculations.

Note, the order in which libusb, pyvisa-py and pyusb are install is important for correct configuration. If you are struggling to connect to the Thorlabs powermeter then type `pyvisa-info` into terminal and check the USB backend is working correctly.

### PyPi Installation

The most stable Qontrol Python API is available through the Python Package Index PyPI. Using a bash terminal or similar, this can be installed as follows:
```bash
pip install ltphotonics
```

### Local Development - Github Installation

The latest development version is available through Github as instructed below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ltphotonics/lightrig.git
cd lightrig/
```

Local installation can be performed using the `setup.py` installation script.

```bash
python setup.py develop
```
